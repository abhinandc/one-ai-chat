Changes Made:

1. Button-shaped nodes - Changed nodes from pill/rounded-xl shape to normal button shape (rounded-lg) with dark background (#1e1e1e)
2. AnimatedBorderTrail component - Created at src/components/ui/animated-border-trail.tsx based on Animata's design. Active nodes now have a color-matched animated border trail that rotates around the node.
3. AnimatedBeam component - Created at src/components/ui/animated-beam.tsx for use with connectors (ready for future integration)
4. Tailwind config - Added trail animation keyframe and animation for the border trail effect
5. CSS @property - Added @property --angle rule to index.css to enable CSS custom property animation
6. Node colors - Each node type has its own trail color matching its icon:

    - Drive: Yellow (#eab308)
    - Jira: Blue (#2563eb)
